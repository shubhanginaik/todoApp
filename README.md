# To-Do App

## Overview

The To-Do App is a simple, yet powerful task management application built with vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to keep track of their daily tasks, mark them as complete, and delete tasks when they're done. The app demonstrates basic JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and local storage.

## Features

- Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- Mark as Complete: Tasks can be marked as complete by clicking on them.
- Delete Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- Persistent Data: The app saves tasks in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.
